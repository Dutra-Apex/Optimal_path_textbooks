# Optimal Reading Sequence in Science textbooks

This algorithm is part of an article that is being published soon.
It's goal is to return the most optimal reading sequence from chapters of science textbooks given a topic.
For instance, if the user wants to learn about Energy, the code would return a list of chapters from Biology, Chemistry and Physics textbooks where 'Energy' is a relevant topic.
Moreover, the algorithm also organizes the chapters from most relevant ones to least relevant.
This organization is defined as the optimal reading sequence for the Energy topic.

Possible applications of the algorithm are:
- Show how topics can be interdisciplinary;
- Help widen study guides;
- Facilitates research on specific topics.
